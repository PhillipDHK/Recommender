# Recommender
Developed a program that would test different algorithms for recommending items. The program made recommendations based on the ratings users and the recommendations were based on books, movies, and eateries. The code read data files in different formats and returned a list of items and a dictionary of ratingscorresponding to
those items. The next module made specific recommendations for individual items based on the ratings each user gave and the final
module would create the overall recommendations for the movies, book, or eateries
